# Hydration Error Fixes

## Problem Summary
The application was experiencing hydration errors due to server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering mismatches. The main causes were:

1. **`localStorage` access during SSR**: Components trying to access browser-only APIs during server rendering
2. **Client-side state mismatch**: Different initial states between server and client
3. **Missing client-side only rendering**: Components that depend on browser APIs not properly isolated

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed AppContext (`lib/context/app-context.tsx`)
- Added `isClient` state to track when component is mounted on client
- Wrapped `localStorage` access in `useEffect` with client-side check
- Prevents `localStorage` access during SSR

```typescript
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true)
}, [])

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isClient) return
  // localStorage access here
}, [isClient])
```

### 2. Fixed useCart Hook (`lib/hooks/use-cart.ts`)
- Same pattern as AppContext
- Added client-side check before accessing `localStorage`
- Prevents hydration mismatch from cart state

### 3. Created ClientOnly Component (`components/ui/client-only.tsx`)
- Utility component that only renders children on client side
- Provides fallback during SSR
- Prevents hydration issues for components that depend on browser APIs

```typescript
export function ClientOnly({ children, fallback = null }: ClientOnlyProps) {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
  }, [])

  if (!isClient) {
    return <>{fallback}</>
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### 4. Updated Header Component (`components/layout/header.tsx`)
- Wrapped cart badge with `ClientOnly` component
- Prevents hydration mismatch from cart count display
- Ensures consistent rendering between server and client

### 5. Updated Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Wrapped entire page content with `ClientOnly`
- Added loading fallback during SSR
- Prevents hydration issues from context-dependent components

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Consider Server Components
Instead of making the entire page client-side, consider using:
- Server components for static content
- Client components only for interactive parts
- This improves performance and SEO

### 2. State Management Strategy
- Use `useEffect` for client-side initialization
- Consider using `next/dynamic` for heavy client components
- Implement proper loading states

### 3. Testing Hydration
- Test with different browsers and devices
- Check console for hydration warnings
- Use React DevTools to inspect component tree

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Implement proper error boundaries

## How to Test

1. **Build and run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for hydration errors

3. **Test cart functionality**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Refresh page
   - Check if cart state persists

4. **Test theme switching**:
   - Switch between light/dark themes
   - Refresh page
   - Verify theme persists

## Common Hydration Issues to Avoid

1. **Browser-only APIs**: Always check if running on client before using
2. **Date/Time functions**: Use consistent timezone handling
3. **Random values**: Avoid `Math.random()` in render functions
4. **External data**: Ensure data consistency between server and client
5. **Conditional rendering**: Be careful with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks

## Files Modified

- `lib/context/app-context.tsx` - Fixed localStorage access
- `lib/hooks/use-cart.ts` - Fixed localStorage access
- `components/ui/client-only.tsx` - New utility component
- `components/layout/header.tsx` - Added ClientOnly wrapper
- `app/page.tsx` - Added ClientOnly wrapper

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Monitor for any remaining hydration warnings
3. Consider implementing server components for better performance
4. Add error boundaries for better error handling
5. Implement proper loading states for better UX
